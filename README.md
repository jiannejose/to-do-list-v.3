# To-Do List (version 3)

I've made versions 1 and 2. From the least maintainable and readable codes to the improving one.

Have fun testing this [Simple To-Do List](https://jiannejose.github.io/to-do-list-v.3/)!


On this third version, I practiced the concept of [MVVM (Model-View-View Model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel).

MVVM facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface – be it via a markup language or GUI code – from development of the business logic or back-end logic (the data model). 


There will be a version 3.1 wherein I will be incorporating Classes in JavaScript with ES6. (I'm currently studying about it.)
